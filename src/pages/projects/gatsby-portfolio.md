This website was made using Gatsby.js, Gatsby is an open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. Main pages of this website were built using React components and templates. While all of the blog post and project descriptions were written in Markdown.

Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to write, using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write, plain text format. This format can then, in seconds, be converted into another markup language, such as HTML! Each blog post and project page is comprised of a markdown file that is transformed into HTML. 

## What’s Inside
One of the benefits of creating a Gatsby website is the vast plugin ecosystem that comes from its growing community. Many features of this website were made with the help of these plugins.  Heres a list of this website’s features, follow the links to see how I did it.
