For one of my college courses I had to make a website and I thought this was the perfect time to experience Vue. 

The whole process was very simple and I can now see why Vue is becoming a dev’s choice. Im excited to work with it on another project in the future. 


## What’s Inside
Heres a list of this app’s standout features:
* Component Integration with [bootstrap-vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap-vue)
* RSS feed for eBay listings provided by [vue-rss-feed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-rss-feed)
* Smooth scroll animation provided by [vue-smooth-scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-smooth-scroll)
* Uses jQuery for form validation and pop-out mobile navbar (not by choice had to do this for the class)
* Deployed with Heroku [here](https://frozen-scrubland-09086.herokuapp.com/)
