For one of my college courses I had to make a website and I thought this was the perfect time to experience Vue. 

The whole process was very simple and I can now see why Vue is becoming a dev’s choice. Im excited to work with it on another project in the future. 

## What’s Inside
Heres a list of this app’s standout features:

* Component Integration w/ Bootstrap
* RSS feed for eBay listings
* Smooth scroll animation provided by
	* vue-smooth-scroll
* Uses jQuery for form validation (not by choice had to do this for the class)

Find out how I added these features and more in my series on Vue [here](link_to_page)
