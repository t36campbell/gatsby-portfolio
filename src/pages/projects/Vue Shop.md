# Summary

* A dynamic website illustrating all services and products for a local business.
* Created with Vue 3, & Bootstrap Vue (HTML, JavaScript, & SCSS).

# Case Study

#### Challenge

* In order to broaden my horizons, I decided to take my first crack at designing a website using the Vue framework. The goal of the website was to display all the services and products offered by a local electronics repair shop.

#### Solution

* Taking inspiration from a popular bootstrap template, I design the site to have a simple white and dark grey color scheme. The overall layout is provided by a Vuetify template and many of the components are from Bootstrap Vue. 

* The google maps feature was integrated using vue2-google-maps, a small project that allows for easy communication with the google maps api. Other features like the forms validation were integrated using vuelidate and the responsiveness of many of the components rely on vue-mq.
