This project started as an experiment with Node.js and turned into so much more. It grew into an app that my employer used to help users understand the security requirements for new passwords and allowed them to copy the generated results to their clipboard. Significant reducing the time service-help agents would take one some of these calls. 

It was a very educational journey from development to dev-ops and everything in between. I learned how to build, package and deploy Electron applications for both Windows and macOS. 

## What’s Inside
Heres a list of this app’s standout features:

* Real-time Validation with regex 
* Generate Passwords and Passphrases
* Packaging Apps for Mac & Windows
* Creating Installers for Mac & Windows
