This is a rebuild of my first release of the system info app using React to dynamically populate the data. The app itself works and successfully passes the data from the system as props to the components. However i have ran into a roadblock that is preventing my ability to successfully package the app.

I have a number of ideas on how to circumvent this issue, however have not had time to troubleshoot further.

## What’s Inside
Heres a list of this app’s standout features:

* Nesting React inside an Electron app
* Pull useful data from a computer w/
	* system-information 

Find out how I added these features and more in my series on Electron + React [here](link_to_page)
