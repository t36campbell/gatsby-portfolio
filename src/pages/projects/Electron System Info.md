Building of the success I found creating my first Electron app, I wanted to create something more useful to my employer. I found my inspiration in an outdated, ugly and virtually useless app, that my work used in the service-help to get the IP addresses off the user’s computer.  This was its sole purpose and I set out to create something better.

Luckily i found an npm package called system-information that communicated with the host device to get information I wanted to display. This is one of the most well documented and easy to use libraries that i have work with and it was paramount to my success with project. 

I created 9 tabs that display the most useful computer data for identification and troubleshooting purposes. The first tab is a shows the most common information that our service-desk requires on most calls. The rest of the tabs are listed in order of importance:

	* Operating System 
	* Network
	* WiFi
	* Battery
	* Processor
	* Graphics
	* Memory
	* Disks

## What’s Inside
Heres a list of this app’s standout features:

* Pull useful data from a computer with system-information 
* Packaging Apps for Mac & Windows
* Creating Installers for Mac & Windows
