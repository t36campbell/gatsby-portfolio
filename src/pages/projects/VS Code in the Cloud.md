This was a fun project that I started before buying a new laptop. The theory was that I could run VS Code inside a VM, using [Coder](https://coder.com/) and cloud resources for development, instead of buying a new laptop. With Google’s [Cloud Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) very generous $300 in free credits, it’s very possible to replace an expensive computer to develop. This setup allows me to code anywhere, on anything with a browser, letting the Cloud do all the heavy lifting.
