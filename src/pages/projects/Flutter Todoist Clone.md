This has been my first run at making a mobile app.  I choose to use Flutter because of how well reviewed Dart has been by the community. I shied away from React Native, even though there would be essentially no learning’s-curve, because of the performance overhead. It seems from what I read, only small bits of Facebook and Instagram are comprised of React Native. While Flutter also has drawbacks in this category, I think small apps are able to get away with being written exclusively in Dart. 

So far the app is just the default Hello-World but the goal of this project is to emulate my favorite to-do list app, [Todoist](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-tasks/id572688855). I wanted to learn the basics before moving on to a move advanced app. 

After this project I should know enough to move on my real goal of combining the features of my 2 favorite running apps ([10K  Trainer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/10k-trainer-by-c25k/id511600311) & [Run Tracker)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/running-distance-tracker-pro/id1205237896) and sprinkling in my own unique feature set. 

## What’s Inside
