* Full stack software developer & aspiring baker.
* United States Air Force veteran striving toward an M.Sc. in Computer Science.
* Assiduously pursue experiences and knowledge, one day at a time.


I'm working hard to live a fulfilling life with my wife and three dogs. I'm balancing creativity and productivity while staving off burnout. I'm learning to say "no" to things I don't want to add to my plate but pour all my efforts into something I enjoy doing.
<br></br>

# How I spend my time:

* Most days, I decompress by cooking a quality meal while listening to one of my favorite podcasts
* Most weekends, I take on longer projects like baking sourdough, croissants, or another intricate recipe
* Procrastinating on home renovation projects and schoolwork
* Last but certainly not least, playing with and training our pups

# My priorities:

* Honing a craft that will lead to self-employment; baker, chef, software developer, who knows
* Reduce burnout by working with, instead of fighting against creativity - you can't force productivity
* Find a balance between working on my goals and my mental, physical, and emotional limits
