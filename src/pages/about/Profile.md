* United States Air Force veteran with a B.Sc. in Information Technology specializing in Web Application Development. 
* Quick study, eager to cultivate the skills needed to become an elite developer.

Every day I wake up with expectation that I will be better than I was the day before. I view every mistake as a learning opportunity and see room to improve with every triumph.

This mindset has served me well in many aspects of my life and the applications I create are no exception. The high standards that I hold myself to show through in the polish of the finished products.

While perseverance and a thirst for knowledge are among my strengths; problem solving and my ability to quickly grasp complex concepts is what sets me apart from my peers.

I think that I have just started to hit my stride, now I am looking for an opportunity to prove myself.
