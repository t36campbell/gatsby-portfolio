Diastatic Malt Powder is made by sprouting barley or wheat berries then milling them after they have dried. Its important to buy hulled barley otherwise the seeds will take far to long to sprout.

First step is to rinse the grain similar to washing rice before cooking. Once the water is mostly clear, add the barley to a container and fill with water just above the grains, then let the grains absorb the water overnight in a cool dark place.

The next day fill a container with water well above the grains, gently stir to spread them around, drain completely then fill agian to just above the grains and rest again overnight. Repeat this process for 3-5 days until most of the grains have sprouted and the tendrils are about the length of the grain itself.

Once the grains have sprouted, they need to be dried slowly at a low temperature. It's vital to not exceed 140ยบ F or 60ยบ C because the diastase enzymes will rapidly breakdown. I spread all the grains in one layer in a sheet tray and used a bread proofing box set to 100ยบ F or 38ยบ C degrees to dry the grains but a warm window sill will safice
