### Intro
Start creating websites in the component era with the developer’s choice, Vue.js

### Prerequisites 
Things you should know before you begin:
1. The Basics (HTML, CSS, JS)
2. Comfortable in the command line
3. Have Node.js installed on your machine
4. Understand how to use npm

### Summary
Cut to the chase with these commands:
```
npm install -g vue-cli
vue init webpack vue-website && cd vue-website
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Extra Credit
Similar to Gatby Vue has serval pre-built starters. Check out vue-starter “The most complete boilerplate for production-ready PWAs.”
```
git clone git clone https://github.com/devCrossNet/vue-starter && cd vue-starter
npm install && npm start
```
