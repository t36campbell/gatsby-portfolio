I have used this [recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/whole-grain-banana-bread-recipe) from King Arthor to make banana, pumpkin and zucchini bread.

Substitute 454g of mashed banana with:
- a 15oz can of pumpkin
- or a large zucchini ~500g shredded

As I was writing this I thought, this recipe can probably be used to make carrot cake bread. So I will be trying that next
